# LiPS-interfaces-data
This repository contains the data for the work titled "Atomic-level Insights into the Highly Conductive Lithium Thiophosphate Solid Electrolytes with Exceptional Stability Against Lithium Metal".

The data is composed of:

Relaxed bulk structures,
Relaxed surfaces with minimum surface formation energies,
Relaxed interfaces between lithium thiophosphates electrolyte and Li-metal anode (Li-P-S//Li).
